# NVIDIA's own prebuilt NCCL and NVSHMEM, taken from the wheels they publish to
# PyPI instead of nixpkgs' from-source builds.
#
# Both are hard `buildInputs` of `torch-bin` (nixpkgs drops the wheel's
# `nvidia-nccl-cu13`/`nvidia-nvshmem-cu13` pip dependencies and substitutes its
# own packages), and neither is in any binary cache: cache.nixos.org carries no
# unfree CUDA at all. Building NCCL from source means compiling its device
# kernels for every CUDA capability in `cudaCapabilities` -- the better part of
# an hour, for collectives that FreeToken never calls, since it serves from a
# single GPU.
#
# These are the same binaries PyPI's torch links against, so this is closer to
# upstream's tested configuration than the source build is, not further from it.
