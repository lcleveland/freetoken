      FreeToken Desktop is FlashML's GUI for FreeToken: a model library, a
      chat console, engine start/stop and live cache/VRAM tuning. It drives a
      local `ft` engine, which this package points at the Nix one through
      FREETOKEN_FT_BIN.

      Upstream ships the app only as a prebuilt binary, so this is a repackaged
      .deb rather than a build from source, and its in-app updater cannot
      replace anything inside the Nix store — upgrade the package instead.
